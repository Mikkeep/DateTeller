# DateTeller
An Electron app, which can tell you what day of the week a chosen date is. Either in the past or in the future.
<br> <br>
The project is based on Doomsday Algorithm, which takes advantage of our calendars so called "Doomsdays". <br> <br>
More of this algoritm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule

<br>
The app is used by giving the input slots values in <b> DD/MM/YY </b> format.
<br>
For single months no leading zero is used.<br>
Same goes for months.
